1. In order to begin working on this project, you will need a source code editor. (We recommend using Visual Studio Code but you can use any that you prefer.)
    a. After selecting an editor, begin by cloning the repository from your terminal. You can do that by typing "git clone https://github.com/sungjah/COMP-2800-Team-BBY-11-ChargeUp. 
    b. There are no other programs you will need to install since this project uses JQuery, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
    c. Start working on the project on a different branch. You can do that by creating your own branch. Type "git checkout -b myBranch dev" on your terminal.
    d. This will automatically change your branch to newly created branch.
    e. After you are done working on it, you can push your changes by typing 1) git add .  2) git commit -m "message of your own" 3) git push
    f. After pushing, you can merge the branch by changing to the dev branch (git checkout dev) and then typing "git merge myBranch"

2. Mapbox API is already used in the project, therefore you do not need to download anything.

3. API key already exists, therefore you do not need to worry about getting a new key.

4. Installation location and order does not matter since there are nothing to install.

5. In order to view the private charging stations (the green markers on the map), you will need to first sign in. You can use the testing account.
